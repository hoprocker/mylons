# mylons

## What it is
Mylons is a medi-framework, inspired by Pylons, but somewhat lighter. Mylons is being developed as my own basic Python web-project bootstrap, but it is open for anyone to use. Mylons is a combination of a microframework, a sql ORM abstraction layer, and a templating language. It's all wrapped up in a virtual env and should require very little effort to get going. It relies heavily on the underlying components, and is really more of a layer of rubber cement holding them together.

## Why
There are many miniframeworks out there, but none that are exactly like I want them to be (the "scratch your own itch" motivation). Mylons works well with my own web dev workflow, and thus is here primarily for my personal use.

## Components
* Flask
* Jinja
* SQLAlchemy

## Getting started
To begin, install virtualenv:

> sudo easy_install virtualenv

Then clone this project:

> mkdir mylons
>
> git clone --depth 1 --recursive git://github.com/hoprocker/mylons.git mylons
>
> cd mylons
>
> python ./setup.py

Now

## further steps
This is a work in progress, more later.
